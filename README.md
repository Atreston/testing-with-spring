# testing-with-spring
A small project made to experiment with the Spring Framework Functionalities. It starts with a small api to exchange information and it will be coded towadrs a full enterprise application.
## Spring Framework Description
[![Spring](https://spring.io/images/spring-logo-9146a4d3298760c2e7e49595184e1975.svg)](https://spring.io/)

The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.

## Spring REST Docs

Spring REST Docs helps you to document RESTful services.

It combines hand-written documentation written with [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) and auto-generated snippets produced with [Spring MVC Test](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle#spring-mvc-test-framework). This approach frees you from the limitations of the documentation produced by tools like [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).

It helps you to produce documentation that is accurate, concise, and well-structured. This documentation then allows your users to get the information they need with a minimum of fuss.

### Spring Boot Config

Spring Boot provides an `@AutoConfigureRestDocs` annotation to [leverage Spring REST Docs in your tests](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-testing.html#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-rest-docs).
